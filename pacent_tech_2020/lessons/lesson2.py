WORKING WITH NUMBERS

> Integers
These are natural counting numbers.

> Floats
Python calls any number with a decimal point a float.

When you divide any two numbers, even if they are integers that result in a
whole number, you’ll always get a float.

If you mix an integer and a float in any other operation, you’ll get a
float as well

> Underscores in numbers
When you’re writing long numbers, you can group digits using underscores
to make large numbers more readable

>>> universe_age = 14_000_000_000

> Multiple Assignment
You can assign values to more than one variable using just a single line

>>> x, y = 2, 3

> Constants
A constant is like a variable whose value stays the same throughout the life
of a program. Python doesn’t have built-­in constant types, but Python pro-
grammers use all capital letters to indicate a variable should be treated as a
constant and never be changed.

>>> MAX_CONNECTIONS = 5000 

Arithmetric Operators
You can add ( + ), subtract ( - ), multiply ( * ), and divide ( / ) numbers in Python.

COMMENTS

A comment allows you to write notes in English within your programs.

Use a hash (#) to write single line comments

>>> # This is a single line comment.

Use triple quotes to write multiple line comments

>>> """
This is a multiple
line comment.
>>> """

> Why write comments?
The main reason to write comments is to explain what your code is supposed
to do and how you are making it work.

Writing good comments makes it easier when collaborating with other
programmers as it would make clear to them what your thought process is
in simple English.
