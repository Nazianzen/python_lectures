WORKING WITH NUMBERS

> Integers
These are natural counting numbers.

> Floats
Python calls any number with a decimal point a float.

When you divide any two numbers, even if they are integers that result in a
whole number, you’ll always get a float.

If you mix an integer and a float in any other operation, you’ll get a
float as well

> Underscores in numbers
When you’re writing long numbers, you can group digits using underscores
to make large numbers more readable

>>> universe_age = 14_000_000_000

> Multiple Assignment
You can assign values to more than one variable using just a single line

>>> x, y = 2, 3

> Constants
A constant is like a variable whose value stays the same throughout the life
of a program. Python doesn’t have built-­in constant types, but Python pro-
grammers use all capital letters to indicate a variable should be treated as a
constant and never be changed.

>>> MAX_CONNECTIONS = 5000 

Arithmetric Operators
You can add ( + ), subtract ( - ), multiply ( * ), and divide ( / ) numbers in Python.
