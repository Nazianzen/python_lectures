TASK 2

> Number Eight: Write addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
operations that each result in the number 8. Be sure to enclose your operations
in print() calls to see the results. You should create four lines that look like this:

>>> print(5+3)

Your output should simply be four lines with the number 8 appearing once
on each line.

> Favorite Number: Use a variable to represent your favorite number. Then,
using that variable, create a message that reveals your favorite number. Print
that message.

> Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and
add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write
because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and
the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence
describing what the program does.
