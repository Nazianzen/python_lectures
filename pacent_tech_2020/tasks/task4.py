> Seeing the World: Think of at least five places in the world you’d like to
visit.
    • Store the locations in a list. Make sure the list is not in alphabetical order.
    • Print your list in its original order. Don’t worry about printing the list neatly,
    just print it as a raw Python list.
    • Use sorted() to print your list in alphabetical order without modifying the
    actual list.
    • Show that your list is still in its original order by printing it.
    • Use sorted() to print your list in reverse alphabetical order without chang-
    ing the order of the original list.
    • Show that your list is still in its original order by printing it again.
    • Use reverse() to change the order of your list. Print the list to show that its
    order has changed.
    • Use reverse() to change the order of your list again. Print the list to show
    it’s back to its original order.
    • Use sort() to change your list so it’s stored in alphabetical order. Print the
    list to show that its order has been changed.
    • Use sort() to change your list so it’s stored in reverse alphabetical order.
    Print the list to show that its order has changed.

> Dinner Guests: Working with one of the programs from task3,
use len() to print a message indicating the number
of people you are inviting to dinner.

> Every Function: Think of something you could store in a list. For example,
you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or any-
thing else you’d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items
and then uses each function introduced since we started talking about lists at least once.
