TASK 5

> Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement
describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code
should look something like this:

>>> car = 'subaru'
>>> print("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
>>> print(car == 'subaru')
>>> print("\nIs car == 'audi'? I predict False.")
>>> print(car == 'audi')

• Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line
evaluates to True or False .
• Create at least ten tests. Have at least five tests evaluate to True and
another five tests evaluate to False .

> More Conditional Tests: You don’t have to limit the number of tests you
create to ten. If you want to try more comparisons, write more tests and add
them to conditional_tests.py. Have at least one True and one False result for
each of the following:
• Tests for equality and inequality with strings
• Tests using the lower() method
• Numerical tests involving equality and inequality, greater than and
less than, greater than or equal to, and less than or equal to
• Tests using the 'and' keyword and the 'or' keyword
• Test whether an item is in a list (Hint: you can do a little research on the 'in' keyword in python)
• Test whether an item is not in a list
